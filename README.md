# dndCharBuilder
Andre and Nick's project together
Nick and Andreâ€™s Project:

Backend: Django
Frontend: React/reactNative 2 frontends, one for desktop, one for mobile, reactNative should help transfer most over
Database: MYSQL
Docker
Do we want to use AWS for image hosting? Character art? 

OAuth2, let google handle logging in logistics

Overall Idea:

DnD character builder

We want a user to be able to log into our website, create multiple different DnD characters. Create a nice UI for a user to see and alter the details of their characters.

Andre notes:
Research Django, review database notes,
